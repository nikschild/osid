All the fraudulent issued certificates were revoked. An interim report laying out details about the incident has been published. The attack shows similarities to the Comodo CA Compromise. According to the published incident investigation report the security measures at DigiNotar were weak. Soon after the incident, Vasco the owner of DigiNotar filed bankruptcy.

The attacker was able to steal the seed data that was used to initialize the SecurID one-time password tokens. The exposed seed data rendered the widely deployed authentication solution, often used to secure remote access to enterprise networks useless. Although RSA emphasized that the attack was carried out by an advanced persistent threat (ATP), the incident report (published by RSA) revealed basic weaknesses like highly critical data being available over the network, and a firewall configuration that let the attacker use FTP to transfer stolen data into the Internet.','RSA Corporation',47,'RSA SecurID customers',14,'',16,'',12,'SecurID token seeds',10,469,'2011-12-03 19:54:33.946437','2011-12-06 20:44:19.021902','t',NULL,NULL);
